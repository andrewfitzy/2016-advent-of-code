# 2016-advent-of-code

This repo contains the solutions for my path of Advent of Code 2016. I complete AoC to get familiar with a technology, its build tools and testing tools, it's kind of a mini-production type workflow I follow.

In this year I chose to use the following tools:
- [Kotlin v1.9.20](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/whatsnew1920.html). Build tools for this year's language of choice.
- [Gradle v8.1.1](https://docs.gradle.org/8.1.1/release-notes.html). From April 2023 which is when I set up this repo.
- [Spotless v6.25.0](https://github.com/diffplug/spotless/releases/tag/gradle%2F6.25.0). Also using the Ktlint formatting configuration [v1.1.1](https://github.com/pinterest/ktlint/releases/tag/1.1.1).
- [Detekt v1.23.3](). Code analysis tool which is useful for finding bugs.
- [Kotlin JUnit](https://kotlinlang.org/api/latest/kotlin.test/). Unit test framework with a Kotlin flavour.

All development was completed using IntelliJ which is an awesome development environment.

## Setup
There is a small setup script that copies the projects pre-commit file to the `hooks` folder of the project's repo. This needs to be run after the project is cloned only. 
```bash
$ ./gradlew initProject  
```

## Building
```bash
$ ./gradlew build  
```

## Testing
```bash
$ ./gradlew check  
```

## Committing
The pre-commit hook should kick-in, when it does it will run `spotless` and `detekt`
```bash
$ git add --all
$ git commit -a
```
